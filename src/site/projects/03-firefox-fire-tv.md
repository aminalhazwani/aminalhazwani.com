introduction:
  In 2018, during a company reorg I was assigned to the Android team and I became the sole designer of Firefox for Fire TV.

<p class="mb-8">
  Designing for a TV is radically different from designing a mobile or a desktop UI. The interface and the amount of information had to be reduced due to the viewing distance. The app had to work well with different light conditions and had to be usable with a remote.
</p>

<p class="mb-8">
  I started by taking on small tasks to get familiar with both the new team and the new product. From there I slowly scaled the scope of my work to the whole app, reshaping a browser initially designed, developed and launched in just 5 days.

  My contribution transformed Firefox for Fire TV into a native TV app that followed platform conventions without sacrificing Firefox privacy-first features and its familiarity.
