introduction:
  I was one of the 6 founding members of the design system initiative, and this program supported the Quantum team that shipped the new Firefox in November 2017 along with the new Photon UI language.

<p class="mb-8">
  We started by auditing the Quantum and Photon work, from the design files to the code. We tested UI variations across devices and screens, and combined the small differences in a single source of truth.
</p>

<p class="mb-8">
  Everything we did was documented in a website that we used to showcase the state of the art: colors, typography, icons, components, patterns, copy and resources.
</p>

<p class="mb-8">
  In addition to that, we defined workflows, built and shipped tools enabling a team of 40+ people to work more efficiently and invest more time in research and testing.
</p>

<p class="mb-8">
  We also launched a company-wide design tokens initiative to promote shared design decisions across 10+ products and 5 OS platforms.
</p>

<p class="mb-8">
  We used every opportunity to promote the value of our work, it could be 10 minutes before our weekly UX meeting or a presentation in front of the whole Firefox engineering team during our bi-annual company retreat.
</p>

<p>
  The work that we did was mostly operational but I learned to use my design skills to brainstorm, negotiate, iterate, advise, coordinate and help other people to design better and more efficiently.
