        I really enjoy to design and build things on and off the web. I have a strong passion for typography and animations (if they provide meaning with motion). When I am not busy watching tv-series I enjoy writing about design. I currently live in beatiful Berlin. In my past life I was a graphic designer and some of my works have been publish here and there.

        The design of this website was inspired by the article “The Web’s Grain” written by Frank Chimero. The typography is set in Neue Hass Unica. The whole thingy is build with Jekyll and hosted on Amazon S3. The CSS is written following Tachyons specs (I am not fully convicend of this approach but let’s give it some time). I do not own the story “What is Code?”: The texts and the pictures used for Newsboy are property of Bloomberg Business.
