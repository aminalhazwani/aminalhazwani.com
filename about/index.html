<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am a twenty-something designer and wannabe developer from Italy. I focus on web and interaction design with a genuine passion for typography.</p>

<p>I’m currently working in Berlin with <a href="http://arillo.net">Arillo GmbH</a> as a Designer. I am lucky enough to work with incredible developers. Together we improve the experience of our clients’ products.</p>

<p>Right now we are developing the new website for the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (where I graduated with honors just a few months ago). The whole thing is done in the open, every step is visible under the <a href="http://unibz.github.io/timeline/">project timeline</a>.</p>

<p>I am also working on a couple of side projects (i.e. a podcast which I hope to release soon). I also spend a lot of time watching tv-series.</p>
