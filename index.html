<p>
  I lead Design Operations at <a class="light-gray" href="http://accurat.it/">Accurat</a>, a data-driven research, design, and innovation studio based in Milan, Italy.
</p>

<p>
  Until 2018, I lived in Berlin and worked for <a class="light-gray" href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. I designed web experiences for TVs and smart assistants powered by Amazon’s Alexa. I also contributed to the launch of the Firefox Design System.
</p>

<p>
  In 2016, I taught Web and Media Design at the M.A. in Eco-Social Design in Bolzano, Italy. I co-wrote a piece for <a class="light-gray" href="https://alistapart.com/article/motion-with-meaning-semantic-animation-in-interface-design"></a> A List Apart.

<p>
  Between 2009–16 I ran a one-man <a class="light-gray" href="https://studio.aminalhazwani.com/">studio</a>, specialized in design for screens. I produced work for Google, Studio Mut, Arillo, Unibz and more.
