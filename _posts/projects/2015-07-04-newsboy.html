      Tl; Dr; Newsboy is my BA thesis. It is a mobile app for journalists that allows them to easily create video news-trailers of their most valuable stories.

      Today news are consumed on devices that are interactive by their nature. So, if editors do not profit from these powerful tools, the output they produce becomes increasingly stale compared to more elaborate and attractive interactions of apps such as Candy Crush or Netflix.

      My aim was to give the rightful attention to the stories that matter, but that are presented in a way that is not sufficiently compelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my research I understood that short videos are one of the most successful formats for raising attention online. Actually big major news providers – such as the New York Times or the Guardian – are already promoting their stories with short videos. But of course they have in-house video teams that help reporters achieve this. Moreover, I learned in how far social networks drive most of the traffic to news websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Journalists usually spend a lot of time writing great stories, but how can they effectively promote them? Here is where Newsboy, the app I designed, comes in handy. Newsboy allows reporters – also the ones who have no video skills at all – to create a teaser video of their stories in the blink of an eye. Then they can share it on different social networks such as Instagram, Facebook or Twitter. Actually, all these platforms have recently invested on new features that simplify the process of recording and watching videos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newsboy comes at perfect time and lets journalists give visibility to their stories in a simple, fast and engaging way.

    <h3>First test</h3>
    <p>
      Before diving into designing the app I wanted to test if my idea was effective enough. So what I did was first taking a long news story and second I tried to build a trailer out of it.

      An article from the Italian weekly magazine Internazionale got my attention. It’s titled <q>6000 euro per essere abbandonati in mezzo al mare</q> (6000 euros to be abandoned in the middle of the see) and it’s the desperate story of thousands and thousands of refugees looking for peace far away from their country. It’s a bit less then 2000 words and it would require you around 10 minutes to read it (based on an avarage of 200—250 words per minute).
