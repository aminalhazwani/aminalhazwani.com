    Tl;Dr; Newboy is my BA thesis. It's a mobile app for journalists that allows them to easily produce video news-trailers of their most valuable stories.

    In March 2015 I graduated with honours at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano. Newsboy is the title of my BA thesis and the final result. And this is the story behind it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Today news are consumed on devices that are interactive by their nature. So, if editors do not profit from these powerful tools, the output they produce becomes increasingly stale compared to more elaborate and attractive interactions of apps such as Candy Crush or Netflix.

    My aim was to give the rightful attention to the stories that matter, but that are presented in a way that is not sufficiently attractive. In my opinion it's nearly impossible to catch the attention of potential news readers only relying on the story title and subtitle on their social network feeds.

    Journalists usually spend a lot of time writing great stories, but how can they effectively promote them?
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    During my thesis research I understood that short videos are one of the most successful formats for raising attention online. Actually big major news providers – such as the New York Times or the Guardian – are already promoting their stories with short and catchy videos. But of course they have in-house badass video teams that take care of this task. How can I as designer give the possibility also to freelance journalists or small newsrooms that have no resources to produce attractive video-trailers.
  </p>

<section class="project_section">
  <h3>First step</h3>
  <p>
    Before getting started with the desig the tool I wanted to test if my idea was effective enough. First I had to test if it was possible to produce a video-trailer starting from a news article. In my opinion if I want the app to succeed I should definitely not ask reporters to produce extra content for the news trailer. 
  </p>
  <p>
    So what I did was first taking a story and second I tried to build a trailer my own. An article from the Italian weekly magazine Internazionale got my attention. It’s titled <em>6000 euro per essere abbandonati in mezzo al mare</em> (6000 euros to be abandoned in the middle of the see) and it’s the desperate story of thousands and thousands of refugees looking for peace far away from their home country. It’s a bit less than 2000 words and it would require you around 10 minutes to read it (based on an average reading speed of 200—250 words per minute).
  </p>
  <p>
    I opened Photoshop and with the interplay of layers and the timeline tool I tried to narrate the story with a short video. By only splitting the title in different slides and adding the images that were already present in the article I was able to easily create a video-trailer for the story.
  </p>

  </div>
  <p>
    The result was quite pleasant. I decided to push in that direction. I took a second story. And this time I tried to create the video not only with title and images but also with words from the article. I remembered that few days before I read a terrific story on Medium by Virginia Hughes. It's a 6000 words piece and it took me literally more than half an hour to read it all. That was the perfect story that needed a trailer in order to be rightfully promoted. In this scenario a title and a subtiles were definitely not enough in order to catch the attention of potential readers. I limited my timeline to 15 seconds which is the maximal video length allowed on Instagram.
  </p>

  </div>
  <p>
    Also in this case, with the simple combination of the title, the pictures and some words from the article I was able to create an attractive news-trailer.
  </p>
  <p>Somenthing that I naturally was to create a square video. </p>

<section class="project_section">
  <h3>Designing the tool</h3>
  <p>
    Proven that was possible to produce a short video with just the content from a news article I decided that it was time to go on with the development of my idea. Without too much thinking I decided I wanted to design an app. I think that an app is the best option for such tool. Usually an app does not require any particular knowledge in order to be used and most of the times the learning curve is really low if not absent. Moreover "forcing" journalists to produce the news-trailer on their mobile device would help them develop something which is already optimised for mobile consumption. This is also a limit from a design perspective. In most of the cases conceiving a desktop application ends with plenty of features due to the larger space available and obviously with a higher learning curve. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The small screen wasn't the only limit. I also decided that I wanted to limit the number of choices that a reporter could do. What he or she could basically do is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>create a text slide;</li>
    <li>add a photo or video from the library;</li>
    <li>or directly shoot in the app.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With this approach the journalist can just focus on his or her story without taking care of technical details that are not relevant for him or her.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before diving into designing the user interface I took a look at some video-editing application because that was the result that I wanted to avoid. Plenty of features and buttons constraint into a small screen. I immediately noticed that all the app I analysed had a horizontal timeline. That felt really unnatural for a smartphone screen. That's when I decided that my app should have had a vertical timeline. Fuck yeah. 
  </p>
  <figure class="project_image">
    {% picture newsboy-video-editing-app.jpeg alt="Apple iMovie iPhone app" %}
    <figcaption>Apple iMovie iPhone app.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    So armed with my trusted Pentel and paper I started wireframing the user interface. Something I tried to keep always in mind while drawing the app is to design and offer just one action per screen. I really tried to keep the learning curve as much as possible close to zero.

    One thing at a time. Virgin America and iOS
  </p>
  <p>
    At first I kept the basic actions in a separate slide-in window. A very common behavior on both iOS and Android devices. But I wasn't happy with the result. I think we should think more carefully about the kind of interactions we design and implement instead of taking the producers guidelines for granted. 
  </p>

    <figcaption class="u-push-top-none">Looking at this sketch today feels like prehistory.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    In a second round I tried to give to the interactions a stronger semantic meaning. UI elements should not just appear from nowhere but they should naturally react to the user actions. That's why in this stage I decided that, for example, the basic actions selection should appear directly from the '+' button.

      As you can see in the splash screen the user must face just one decision. Either go through the guided tour or dive into the app. Same thing for the timeline screen. The user can tap on the '+' button. As said, one screen one main action.

    <h3>How the heck do I call you?</h3>
    <p>
      Between wireframing and visual style there was a small parenthis about the possible name for this tool. I know what you thinking. Name should be the last. But let me tell you how it happened. I remember  I was just talking about this project to a friend of mine and the moment after we found ourselves in the middle of a brainstorming. It was crazy and awesome at the same time. A lot was placed on the table. Of course news and video were our main focuses but we couldn't managed to find somenthing really catchy. But then, suddenly, we wondered: how the hell were named these kids from the twenties, thirties selling newspapers on the streets. We googled it and we couldn't have been more right. Newsboy. That was the perfect name. 
    </p>

    <h3>Visual style and direction</h3>
    <p>
      Being quite happy with the basic user flow and super happy with the name I decided it was time to do some design explorations. Playing around helps me focus on the user interactions and it stimulates me to think about possible handy features. I decided to use Sketch. I've been playing around with it for quite some time but never very seriously. So I took this opportunity to improve my knowledge but also because I find two features really convenient. The first one is Sketch Mirror. I think being able to check your UI directly on your device - in a one on one scale - is really helpful. The second one is the export option which was vital in the prototyping phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early stages of the design I kept a more classical and newspaper-oriented style. A serif elegant font combined with pastel colors.

      Even though I didn't dislike it wasn't what I was aiming for. I wanted to not only make news attractive again with a video-trailer but I wanted to try to bring some fresh air, also from a style point of you. This is one of the main reason behind my eternal love to the new bloomberg.com redesign.
    </p>
    <p>
      So deleted the classy fonts I opted for something more fresh and young. The second pivot to solve were colors. Everyone know I suck at choosing colors (as I suck at choosing CSS class names) so I run deeply into a crazy exploration that can be translated in something similar to this.

    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
    <p>
      While continuing the research for the perfect palette I thought it was time for some interactions. I strongly believe that interactions should be a big part of the design process and should not be kept at the end, when the user interface is finished. They help us improve the UI in many directions. They help us consider things we didn't consider due to the static state of our assets and they push our boundaries in terms of user experience and user flow. Something really beneficial is that interactions force you to this off the screen. They constrain you to break that beautiful amount of space that you love so much and in which you feel so safe. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my first experience with app interactions and I didn't know where to start. I started googling around in order to find a tool that would allow me to animate the assets I did so far. Many where the results but at the end, after trying few of them, I decided to go for Quartz Composer combined with the amazing Origami library powered by the Facebook Design Team. The options that I discarded were InVision App and Framer.js. The first one because the impression I had was that you could put some fancy animation over your pixel perfect mockups. On the other hand Framer.js looked pretty solid but my very tiny knowledge of JavaScript have pushed me towards somenthing more visual like Quartz. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to get to know the program I watched some tutorials and among them the one from Jay Thrash was the most useful. https://vimeo.com/85578380 It helped me understand the basic functions of Quartz and how I could play with the different modules provided by the Origami Library.
