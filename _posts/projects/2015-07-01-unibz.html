      Tl;Dr; Newboy is my BA thesis. It's a mobile app for journalists that allows them to easily produce video news-trailers of their most valuable stories.

      In March 2015 I graduated with honours at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano. Newsboy is the title of my BA thesis and the final result. And this is the story behind it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Today news are consumed on devices that are interactive by their nature. So, if editors do not profit from these powerful tools, the output they produce becomes increasingly stale compared to more elaborate and attractive interactions of apps such as Candy Crush or Netflix.

      My aim was to give the rightful attention to the stories that matter, but that are presented in a way that is not sufficiently attractive. In my opinion it's nearly impossible to catch the attention of potential news readers only relying on the story title and subtitle on their social network feeds.

      Journalists usually spend a lot of time writing great stories, but how can they effectively promote them?

    <p>
      During my thesis research I understood that short videos are one of the most successful formats for raising attention online. Actually big major news providers – such as the New York Times or the Guardian – are already promoting their stories with short and catchy videos. But of course they have in-house badass video teams that take care of this task. How can I as designer give the possibility also to freelance journalists or small newsrooms that have no resources to produce attractive video-trailers.

    <h3 class="project_text-title">First step</h3>
    <p>
      Before diving into designing the tool I wanted to test if my idea was effective enough. First I had to test if it was possible to produce a video-trailer starting from a news article. In my opinion if I want the app to succeed I should definitely not ask reporters to produce extra content for the news trailer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So what I did was first taking a story and second I tried to build a trailer my own. An article from the Italian weekly magazine Internazionale got my attention. It’s titled <em>6000 euro per essere abbandonati in mezzo al mare</em> (6000 euros to be abandoned in the middle of the see) and it’s the desperate story of thousands and thousands of refugees looking for peace far away from their home country. It’s a bit less than 2000 words and it would require you around 10 minutes to read it (based on an average reading speed of 200—250 words per minute).
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened Photoshop and with the interplay of layers and the timeline tool I tried to narrate the story with a short video. By only splitting the title in different slides and adding the images that were already present in the article I was able to easily create a video-trailer for the story.

      The result was quite pleasant. I decided to push in that direction. I took a second story. And this time I tried to create the video not only with title and images but also with words from the article. I remembered that few days before I read the terrific story by Gramae Wood What ISIS really wants edited by The Atlantic. It's a XXXXX words piece and it took me literally more than 45 minutes to read it all. That was the perfect story that needed a trailer in order to be rightfully promoted. In this scenario a title and a subtiles were definitely not enough in order to catch the attention of potential readers. I limited my timeline to 15 seconds which is the maximal video length allowed on Instagram.

      Also in this case, with the simple combination of the title, the pictures and some words from the article I was able to create an attractive news-trailer.

    <h3 class="project_text-title">Designing the tool</h3>
    <p>
      Proven that was possible to produce a short video with just the content from a news article I decided that it was time to go on with the development of my idea. Without too much thinking I decided I wanted to design an app. I think that an app is the best option for such tool. Usually an app does not require any particular knowledge in order to be used and most of the times the learning curve is really low if not absent. Moreover "forcing" journalists to produce the news-trailer on their mobile device would help them develop something which is already optimised for mobile consumption. This is also a limit from a design perspective. In most of the cases conceiving a desktop application ends with plenty of features due to the larger space available and obviously with a higher learning curve. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The small screen wasn't the only limit. I also decided that I wanted to limit the number of choices that a reporter could do. What he or she could basically do is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>create a text slide;</li>
      <li>add a photo or video from the library;</li>
      <li>or directly shoot in the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With this approach the journalist can just focus on his or her story without taking care of technical details that are not relevant for him or her.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Before diving into designing the user interface I took a look at some video-editing application because that was the result that I wanted to avoid. Plenty of features and buttons constraint into a small screen. I immediately noticed that all the app I analysed had a horizontal timeline. That felt really unnatural for a smartphone screen. That's when I decided that my app should have had a vertical timeline. Fuck yeah. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So armed with my trusted Pentel and paper I started wireframing the user interface. Something I tried to keep always in mind while drawing the app is to design and offer just one action per screen. I really tried to keep the learning curve as much as possible close to zero. 
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I kept the basic actions in a separate slide-in window. A very common behavior on both iOS and Android devices. But I wasn't happy with the result. I think we should think more carefully about the kind of interactions we design and implement instead of taking the producers guidelines for granted.

      In a second round I tried to give to the interactions a stronger semantic meaning. UI elements should not just appear from nowhere but they should naturally react to the user actions. That's why in this stage I decided that, for example, the basic actions selection should appear directly from the '+' button.

      As you can see in the splash screen the user must face just one decision. Either go through the guided tour or dive into the app. Same thing for the timeline screen. The user can just tap on the '+' button. As said, one screen one action.

      Being quite happy with the basic user flow I decided it was time to do some design explorations. Playing around helps me focus on the user interactions and it stimulates me to think about possible handy features. I decided to use Sketch. I've been playing around with it for quite some time but never very seriously. So I took this opportunity to improve my knowledge but also because I find two features really convenient. The first one is Sketch Mirror. I think being able to check your UI directly on your device - in a one on one scale - is really helpful. The second one is the export option which was vital in the prototyping phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early stages of the design I kept a more classical and newspaper-oriented style. A serif elegant font combined with pastel colors.

      Even though I didn't dislike it wasn't what I was aiming for. I wanted to not only make news attractive again with a video-trailer but I wanted to try to bring some fresh air, also from a style point of you. This is one of the main reason behind my eternal love to the new bloomberg.com redesign.
