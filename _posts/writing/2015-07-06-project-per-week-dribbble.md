title: One (old)-project per week on Dribbble
category: writing
---

Today I looked into my archive. I try to figure out what I did and what I achieved as a designer so far. During my small and humble career (I started working as freelance designer during my bachelor degree, back in 2009) I had the opportunity to work on many different projects: from basic graphic design commissions to pretty challenging web projects.

It's interesting to look at your old projects. You feel embarrassed and proud at the same time. It's a weired feeling. But I should not feel embarrassed, good or bad the work I did helped me to became who I am and how I work today. 

But the most funny thing is how many times I tried to organized my own portfolio. Always without success. I found several work selections and what is really interesting is to see my evolution from being a full-stack graphic designer to a passionate web dude. 

It's a pity that this work has been living only on my hard drive. I want to give to it the rightful visibility. Some of these works make me very proud and even if I don't work as a graphic designer anymore I think they deserve to be online. So, here is the idea. I will share one old project per week on Dribbble! 

Why not on this website? I would not put them here because – as said – they don't promote the work I do now but I want say thank you to these projects. So, if you are curious, just go on my [Dribbble page](#). I created a project folder where I will collect all the old works every week. Stay tuned!
