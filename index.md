# Amin Al Hazwani

I lead DesignOps at [Accurat](http://accurat.it/), a data-driven research, design, and innovation team in Milan, Italy.

Previously, I lived in Berlin and worked for [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org/). There, I designed web experiences for TVs, and smart assistants powered by Amazon’s Alexa. I also launched the Firefox Design System to support the not-for-profit multi-platform browser factory.

I taught Web and Media Design at the M.A. in Eco-Social Design in Bolzano, Italy. During this tenure I co-wrote a piece for [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/motion-with-meaning-semantic-animation-in-interface-design).

Between 2009–16 I ran a one-man [studio](https://studio.aminalhazwani.com/), specialized in design for screens. I produced work for Google, Studio Mut, Arillo, Unibz and more.
