I’m currently working in Berlin with [Arillo GmbH](http://arillo.net/) as a Designer. I am lucky enough to work with incredible developers. Together we improve the experience of our clients’ products.

Right now we are developing the new website for the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (where I graduated with honors just a few months ago). The whole thing is done in the open, every step is visible under the [project timeline](http://unibz.github.io/timeline/).

I am also working on a couple of side projects (i.e. a podcast which I hope to release soon). I also spend a lot of time watching tv-series.
