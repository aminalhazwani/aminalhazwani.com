# Amin Al Hazwani

I do Design Operations at [Accurat](http://accurat.it/), a data-driven research, design, and innovation studio in Milan, Italy.

Previously, I lived in Berlin and worked for [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org/). I designed web experiences for TVs and smart assistants powered by Amazon’s Alexa. I also contributed to the launch of the Firefox Design System.

I taught Web and Media Design at the M.A. in Eco-Social Design in Bolzano, Italy. I co-wrote a piece for [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/motion-with-meaning-semantic-animation-in-interface-design).

Between 2009–16 I ran a one-man [studio](https://studio.aminalhazwani.com/), specialized in design for screens. I produced work for Google, Studio Mut, Arillo, Unibz and more.
